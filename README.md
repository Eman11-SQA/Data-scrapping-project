A web scraping project that systematically collects book data from publicly available websites and organizes it into a structured and usable format. The scraper is designed to navigate through multiple pages, locate relevant HTML elements, and extract detailed information such as book titles, authors, prices, ratings, availability status, categories, and brief descriptions. The collected data is cleaned to remove inconsistencies and then stored in formats like CSV or JSON for easy access and further processing.

This project focuses on demonstrating the complete data scraping workflow, including sending HTTP requests, handling responses, parsing HTML content, managing pagination, and dealing with common scraping challenges such as missing data or layout changes. It is suitable for learning and practicing web scraping concepts, data handling, and automation, while following ethical scraping practices and respecting website usage policies.
